# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Node.js Version

This project is designed to work with Node.js version v.18.X.X . It's recommended to use the stable version of Node.js for compatibility.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs the necessary dependencies for the app. Run this command before starting the app for the first time.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
